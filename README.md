# Intermittent Fasting Clockface for Fitbit Sense and Versa3
I recently bought fitbit versa 3 and was disappointed that it doesn't have an intermittent fasting tracking app.
So I decided to spend a few hours and hack a simple clockface that would show me when to eat.


Use this simple, open-source clockface for your time resctricted feeding regime, and feel free to fork and modify it.
